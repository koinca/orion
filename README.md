I have angularJS experience and wants to learn REACT.  I couldn't find any basic app has all the latest packages that I'm looking for so I just building one myself.  This is a boilerplate I put together for creating a react app with the following components:

react
webpack 4
babel
sass-loader
bootstrap 4
react-intl
react-router
react-virtualized
react-vis

To get going, just
npm install
npm start
